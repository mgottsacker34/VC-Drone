# VC-Drone

This system will provide a voice control interface to drones for end users.
This project utilizes natural language processing and understanding to map 
intents from human conversation to drone commands. Ultimately, this project
will make the complex task of drone piloting more accessible to humans.

The target drone architectures includes a Pixhawk 4 flight controller running 
ROS and using MAVROS to communicate via MAVLink, and a Pixhawk 4 running 
DroneKit to communicate via MAVLink.
